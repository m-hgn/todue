# TODO
Things the app should be able to do

- [ ] Display UI that looks nice and is managable + extendable
- [ ] Parse Markdown files
  - [ ] ignoring any non list element.
  - [ ] enabling nested lists of checkboxes for sub-TODOs.
  - [ ] ignoring any sublists of checkboxes that themselves aren't checkboxes.
- [ ] Create and change Markdown files
- [ ] Make users able to add due dates or priorities their TODOs
  - [ ] dates or priorities apply per block of TODOs
    - in case of dates, the TODOs are a sublists of lists of dates
    - in case of prios, the TODOs are a list of checkboxes sorted by priority
